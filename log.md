### Day 1: May 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I am solving the Cash Register on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've used a lot of time testing how to calculate the change array. I learn how to use the while loop or Math.min(denomination,total/denomination) to directly calculate the correct change for each denomination as in real life. And, the most important part is how to get rid of the javascript precision loss with Math.round(x*100)/100 or Math.floor!
