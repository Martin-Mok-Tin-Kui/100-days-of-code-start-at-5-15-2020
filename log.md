### Day 1: May 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I am solving the Cash Register on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've used a lot of time testing how to calculate the change array. I learn how to use the while loop or Math.min(denomination,total/denomination) to directly calculate the correct change for each denomination as in real life. And, the most important part is how to get rid of the javascript precision loss with Math.round(x*100)/100 or Math.floor!

### Day 2: May 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I try to implement the Depth-first search to find all the paths from one node to another in an undirected graph.

**Thoughts**: I've tried to understand when to use differnet graph representation: Edge lists, Adjacency matrices and Adjacency lists. Use integer as graph labeling. Tried to implement recursive Depth-first search without the need to use stack. Keep a visited node list so as to prevent cyclic recursion of the program.

### Day 3: May 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the recursive Depth-first search to find all the paths in an undirected graph, that each node can only be visited once in each path.

**Thoughts**: I used javascript Map of Set to create the adjacency list for the graph, and used an allPath array to store the paths. The dfs start at any chosen node and eventually find all the paths with the constraint that the end node is the node that all the neighbours were visited. The base case for terminating the recursion is that the current node have no unvisited neighbours.

### Day 4: May 19, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Used create-react-app to get json data from an URL endpoint, and displayed them as a list. refreshed CSS flexbox layout and how to do 2D layout with flexbox inside flexbox.

**Thoughts**: React JSX component make server-side rendering and complex UI building very simple and structured using OOP concepts, and we can use the javascript objects and variables inside JSX is elegant. React and Javascript Syntax and structure are clearner and easier to read then PHP or JSP. The Fetch API is also more readable that AJAX API.  
Added the flexbox css to index.css inside src folder of react app as index.js imported the index.css but not App.js and index.js is responsible for inserting the whole App component to the root div of index.html in the public folder.  
Changed the App function component generated by creat-react-app to class component so as to use constructor to initialize state and componentDidMount to write fetch API codes to change state.

### Day 5: May 20, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
Added onClick event for the item in the list and show the details to different div.  
Learnt about how to composite react components and pass state as props from parent component to child component as well as change the parent state from child component.  
Learnt about how to change state in react with this.setState() and define initial state with this.state.
Learnt about how to pass arguments into an event handler in react.
Used object destructuring for props and state object.  
Found out how to check for empty object by JSON.stringify(item) === '{}' or Object.keys(obj).length === 0.

**Thoughts**: 
React change the tranditional DOM selection and manipulation in vanilla javascript by state handling in each components and div replacement as well as inserting JSON data so easy by JSX.  
Also, I found out that if I want to add a marker to google map and show it on one component, I have to open a billing account to use the google map api. Google should provide a free testing key with limitation so that I won't afarid of being charged when I forget to shutdown the website after testhttps://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html
